# MedInsuranceMiniProj
In this project, I have examined how factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs.
Problem Statement- Medical insurance costs are calculated based on a formula which requires certain parameteres from a client such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs. The aim of the project is to estimate the medical insurance costs of an individual given the relevant data and calculate the difference between actual and estimated insurance costs.
The concepts applied in this project are:
-Method definition and invoking
-Data Structures (1D List and 2D Lists)
-Looping
-Programming Logic
