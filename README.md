The following provides context for: "Medical_Insurance_Estimation_Mini_Project.py" file
In this project, I have examined how factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs.
Problem Statement- Medical insurance costs are calculated based on a formula which requires certain parameteres from a client such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs. The aim of the project is to estimate the medical insurance costs of an individual given the relevant data and calculate the difference between actual and estimated insurance costs.
The concepts applied in this project are:
-Method definition and invoking
-Data Structures (1D List and 2D Lists)
-Looping
-Programming Logic

The following provides context for: "Medical_Insurance_Cost_Record.py"
In this project, I worked with Python lists to store medical insurance cost data and then gained meaningful insight into that data. The medical record dealt with in this project comprised only 11 observations. However, the skills applied here can be translated to bigger data sets. In connection to this, the following features of lists were utilised in this project:
-.append()
-List slicing and indexing
-2D list manipulation
-zip function
-.count()
-.sort()

The following provides context for: "Medical_Insurance_Estimates_vs_Costs.py"
In this file, I have used list comprehensions and for loops to calculate average insurance costs for a random group of medical insurance clients. There are 3 initial lists containing the names, estimated insurance costs and actual insurance costs of the clients. Using for loops, I manipulated these lists to calculate average estimated costs, compare the average with individual insurance costs and update the list of estimated insurance costs using list comprehensions.
